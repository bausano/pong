# Pong

## Again?

This pong game is somewhat original in the input and output interface. It is meant to be projected on a single coloured surface (ideally white) by a projector. The projector's lamp should be headed towards the Earth's core to follow the shortest line in the space.

...

The projector projects the game on a table. There is a camera next to the projector watching the movement of whatever the user chooses to control their paddle with. It can be their finger, a pen or an RC car.
